Created this code with Bolt.New, testing it and using it over the course of about fifteen minutes. Talk about advancing technology.

Here's the instructions if you want to use this on your blogger.com site

To use this code:

1. Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID with your actual YouTube video ID (the part after v= in the YouTube URL)
2. You can add multiple containers with different video IDs on the same page
3. Each video will work independently with its own hover/touch controls

Shhhh!
